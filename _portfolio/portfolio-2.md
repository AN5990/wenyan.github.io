This paper introduces five papers with regard to HDR
images reconstruction using deep learning methods.Three
of them are muti-image reconstruction and two of them are
single-image reconstruction.I analyze these methods and
gives a original table to summarize their characteristics and
differences.Besides,I notice that HDR images reconstruction still faces many challenges,and I propose some aspects
that can be researched in future work.
